# BUNTOS-2018-Sales-Analysis-A-Power-BI-Case-Study
The dataset contains sales transactions from various cities, product categories, payment types, and customers. I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that breaks down:  - Order count and revenue - Top-performing categories and cities - Monthly and daily sales patterns - Customer preferences and payment behavior

-## ðŸ’¡ Key Business Insights

### 1. Electronics Drive Revenue
Electronics stood out as the most purchased category, contributing **â‚¦166K** in sales â€” over 50% of total orders. This product line is clearly a core revenue driver and should be prioritized in marketing and inventory.

### 2. Indore Leads by Volume
Among all cities, **Indore** recorded the highest purchase volume (â‚¦64K), followed by **Mumbai** (â‚¦59K). These are key growth markets that can benefit from location-based promotions and faster logistics.

### 3. Sales Dip Mid-Year
Revenue started strong in Q1 with peaks in January and March but dropped significantly in July. A recovery began in August and spiked again in November.

> ðŸ”Ž This pattern shows clear **seasonality** in customer spending. Targeted campaigns can be scheduled to boost Q2 performance.

### 4. Sunday Is the Best Sales Day
An interesting behavioral insight: **Sunday recorded the highest average daily revenue (â‚¦355.77)**, while Monday was the weakest. Consumers tend to shop more on weekends.

> âœ… Actionable Tip: Run flash sales, product launches, and ad campaigns over the weekend.

### 5. Cash Still Dominates
**Cash on Delivery (COD)** was the most preferred payment method (347 orders), generating â‚¦155K. While UPI and card payments are growing, COD remains trusted.

> ðŸ§  Recommendation: Introduce small discounts or loyalty points for digital payments to reduce the risks and costs tied to COD.
